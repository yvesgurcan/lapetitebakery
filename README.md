This is the CodeIgniter version of my bakery software, La Petite Bakery.

# Database
Please note that you need a database to log in.
When you browse the website on your server, go to [LPB]/setup (where [LPB] is the folder where you installed La Petite Bakery). On this page, you will find a one-click setup that will create a user and some tables necessary for the software to work properly.

Have fun!
